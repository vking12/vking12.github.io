A collection of projects I did or am doing.

Root directory: SciVis data manipulation from the IEEE SciVis contest from 2016.

Vis_Tool: VAST Challenge 2017 -- Mini-Challenge 3 initial manipulation using three.js

Vis_Tool2: VAST Challenge 2017 -- Mini-Challenge 3 instead of using three.js I used canvases (load much faster) and added
functionality like the ability to choose specific dates as well as whatever mode you would like to see them in.
I call it God Mode.

Most of my projects will be linked here.
