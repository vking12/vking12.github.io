Create the greatest visual representation of both projects worked on and the extent of the data used.
This will include the following order:
Sum 17
- Articulate
  - Alexa (created using EVL servers not AWS)
    - Reindeer Game modified to work with servers
    - Articulate Voice (error checking and working on communicating with Articulate's Hopper)
    - Omicron for communication rather than websockets directly to Hopper server
  - Single Window manipulation (relative and absolute movements, close, max, restore)
  - Multiple Window manipulation (close set of windows, still a bit buggy)
  - IRB certified and renewed CITI to gain access to user studies on Articulate software

- King Tiger Tank game integrated into Cave2
- D3 to create visualization of Gun Shootings (color map and bubble map view) -- demo
- Manipulation of SciVis data 2016 to create three.js scene and 2D slice using D3 -- demo
- VAST Challenge 2017 -- Mini-Challenge 3
  - (insert webpage here) God vision tool (rgb, plant health, snow ice, etc.) -- demo
  - include images of previous versions leading up to alpha.

Spring 17
- List course work (a proper visualization)
- Honors Activity: CS 426 (advanced course outside my major)
- Projects
  - EDT: MRDC -- Team glaDOS
    - Explain rules/goal of MRDC
    - Solution and glaDOS specs (mechanical design, micro-controller specs)
    - ADHOC network for live video feed from mounted raspberry pi camera
    - Why ADHOC?
      - Wi-fi not the most reliable during competition
      - lower latency

  - Mechatronics: Team Shedorados
    - competition and team origins
    - versions of the car
      - round 1 - breadboard (pcb corrections done, software considerations, bang bang approach) - video
      - round 2 - pcb and double battery powered (software changes PD control) -- video
    - skills: mechatronics system design, pcb design (altium),

  - Video Game Design:
    - Project Supercomputer
      - 2D game where core mechanic is to consume things until you are large enough to become
        a supercomputer and beyond.
      - Bonus level that implements computer vision to see beyond ordinary sensory inputs.
    - Project Escape Nazism as a Deaf Citizen
      - Soundless decision based 3D game whose objective is to escape Nazi Germany by interacting
        with the game world.
      - Features 7 complete levels, AI, and various NPCs that enhance the open world aspect.
    - Project King Tiger Tank
      - Used original 3D models made with Blender
      - Features 3 unique levels that culminate in the finale.

  - Robotics, Algorithm, and Control: Team Qubits
    - implemented bug0 and bug1 algorithms -- video

Fall 16
- coursework (proper vis)
- Honors Activity: Simple MIPS Assembler
  - readme should be displayed along with screenshots -- share google drive for code
  - IDE used, C programming language, and
  - 45 minute talk on design process and considerations -- include powerpoint
- Electronics I: Gave talk on the viability of Quantum Computing -- include powerpoint

Sum 16
- coursework (proper vis)

Spring 16
- coursework
- Honors Activity: Simulation in Hybrid Virtual Reality
  - Polished game mechanics in Unity
  - Improved overall rendering of game to perform faster (billboarding, etc.)
  - Created UI (main menu, pause menu, etc.)
  - Third party assets to improve overall "look and feel" of the game
  - Testing on other users

Fall 15
- coursework
- Honors Activity: Literary Hell: Comparative Narratives of Dissent
  - discussions on the nature of reality and human psyche.
  - literature includes: (tba)
- Submitted proposal for Honors College grant to work on Simulations in Hybrid VR -- with Prof. Mitchel They's approval
- Attained funding to work on Sims in Hybrid VR
- Simulations in Hybrid Virtual Reality
  - Assembled Team VR
    - Began work with Unreal Engine and Blender
    - Reached out to facility management to get models for UIC's East Campus
    - Pseudo schedule made
    - Conversion of models took a long time
    - Full version of Unity becomes free, changed our game engine to Unity
      and 3D modeling software to 3DS Max

Sum 15
- coursework

Spring 15
- coursework
- Honors Activity: Foundations of Research and Critical Thinking
  - CITI certification for IRB training
- Brief work to improve quality of 3D sound in Cave2 with Audio Engineering Society
- Wrote "Scientia: Critical Analysis On the Nature of Reality for the Modern Philosopher"
  - critical analysis of of modern science and impact on our understanding of reality
  - thorough survey of history, philosophical analysis, and synthesis of argument

Fall 14
- coursework
- submitted application for Honors College -- with guidance of Dr. Matthew Corey
- accepted into Honors College
